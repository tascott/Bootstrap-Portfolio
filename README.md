# Week 3 Challenge - Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

A continuation of a porfolio based website bulit with Bootstrap and minimising media queries - preferring the use of Boostraps built in classes.

Features a sticky footer & bootstrap navbar. Displays the start of a grid for my projects, an "about me" section with contact info, and a list of the skills I should be proficient with come the middle of 2023.

## Installation

Just open index.html in your browser.

## Usage

Static site, just open HTML to run - no backend or JS code. Currently uses placeholders for all but one project, so only the first link is active.
